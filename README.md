** LAWN TENNIS is a sport involving a racquet and ball played on a court with a net running through it but no surrounding walls. Lawn tennis is primarily a summer sport played outdoors, either on courts marked with whitewash on close-cut grass like a cricket pitch, or on asphalt, cinders, gravel, wood, earth, or other substance which can be so prepared as to afford a firm, level, and smooth surface. It is a modern adaptation of the ancient game of tennis (q.v.), with which it is identical as regards the scoring of the game and "set." Although the name "covered-court lawn tennis" refers to the fact that the game is frequently played in winter on the floors of gyms, drill sheds, and other structures, there is no difference in the actual rules of the game.
**Figure 1 depicts the lawn tennis court used for the singles match, which pits one player against another. 1 and the four-handed game (" doubles ") in fig. 2. Two posts that stand three feet outside of the court on either side are supported by a net that is extended across the center of the court. The net is 3 feet, 6 inches tall. at the posts and three feet in the middle. The halfcourt line, which divides the court longitudinally, is only marked at the intersections of the base lines and the two service lines.The right-hand and left-hand courts are the portions of the court that are on each side of the halfcourt line, while the right-hand service court and left-hand service court, respectively, are the portions of these courts that are between the service lines and the net. The 22-inch balls are composed of hollow india-rubber and are completely coated with white flannel. between Ig and 2 oz in diameter. as to weight. The racquets (fig. 3) are wider and lighter than tennis racquets, for which there are no standard measurements.**
