And I will share you the definitions in " Lawn Tennis".

**a sport involving a racquet and ball played on a court with a net running through it but no surrounding walls. Lawn tennis is primarily a summer sport played outdoors, either on courts marked with whitewash on close-cut grass like a cricket pitch, or on asphalt, cinders, gravel, wood, earth, or other substance which can be so prepared as to afford a firm, level, and smooth surface. It is a modern adaptation of the ancient game of tennis (q.v.), with which it is identical as regards the scoring of the game and "set." Although the name "covered-court lawn tennis" refers to the fact that the game is frequently played in winter on the floors of gyms, drill sheds, and other structures, there is no difference in the actual rules of the game.**
